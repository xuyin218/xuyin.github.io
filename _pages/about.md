# Yin Xu

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
Hi, there. I am Yin Xu (ÂæêÊÆ∑), a three-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Mingjun Xiao](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiaomj/indexEN.html). I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with Prof. [Jie Wu](https://cis.temple.edu/~wu/) (Professor, Temple University, Fellow of IEEE/AAAS) and [Guoju Gao](http://web.suda.edu.cn/ggj/) (Associate Professor, Soochow University).

My research interests include mobile computing systems (e.g., Crowdsensing, and data trading), privacy preservation (e.g., Differential privacy and federated learning), and game theory (e.g., Auction and Stackelberg game). I have published several academic papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, including IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, IEEE transactions on industrial informatics, etc.

**I am seeking opportunities for an overseas Research Assistant in 2024 and an overseas Postdoctoral Researcher in 2025. If you are interested in my research, please don't hesitate to contact me.**
